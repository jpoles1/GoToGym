# GoToGym
A go app to tell you to go to the gym.
## Intended Behaviour
- Connect to a google calendar url and fetch events from a "GoToGym" calendar
 - We are currently receiving a webhook from IFTTT after each event in the calendar ends.
- After each gym event passes, send an email asking if the session was completed
- Track attendance on dashboard.
