## Intended Behaviour
- Receive a webhook from IFTTT after each event in the calendar ends (or on other triggers like "Google Assistant" or "Alexa").
- After the registered gym event has occured, the system sends an email asking if the gym session was completed
- Attendance is tracked on a dashboard (see below).
